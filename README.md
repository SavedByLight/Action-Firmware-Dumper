## Notes
* Firmware that has split super image as part of ota/payload won't work.
* Blobs/files that size is over 100MB won't work, GitLab has limit per file size.
* If the file size is over 100MB, action will track it as GIT-LFS.
* Most oplus devices uses generic name "ossi" in build.prop of system, vendor and even in product partition, only odm partition has the right device model/name. If device dump end up having ossi name, don't get confused whether you made a wrong dump or not.
